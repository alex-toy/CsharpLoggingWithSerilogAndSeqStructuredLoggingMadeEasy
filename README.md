# C# Logging With Serilog And Seq - Structured Logging Made Easy

Structured event logging is so much more than just writing a message to a file. .NET Core natively supports structured event logging. Serilog is a logger that takes advantage of these additional features. Serilog is an easy to configure and easy to use logging system that you can plug into a .NET Core project within minutes. We will configure Serilog, see how to use it in a basic logging scenario, then take advantage of the structured logging by hooking up a visual event sink called Seq.
